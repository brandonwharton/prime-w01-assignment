        <li>I have two miniature dachshunds named Peaches and Mia that rule our
            entire house.</li>
        <li>Once upon a time, I did acrobatics and circus performances.</li>
        <li>While my taste in music is pretty diverse, my favorite genre
            is unquestionably bluegrass. Though, I spend more time with
            Audible than with music these days.</li>
        <li id="hiding">Bonus fact! My favorite author currently is Brandon
            Sanderson. If you're up for a time commitment, check out the
            Stormlight Archive. It's worth it.</li>
